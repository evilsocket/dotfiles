It was originally a vim theme, but it's grown from \nthere.\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/F9fHfwh.jpg)\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis theme for Atom is based on \n[Colin T.A. Gray's version](https://github.com/colinta/zenburn) for TextMate.\n\nLike it, it's released under the terms of the MIT license.\n\n## Language Support\n\nI've not tested it with anything except Ruby and Markdown, and both seem to\nwork fine. Because it's a conversion theme, everything that was supported in\nTextMate should be supported in Atom.\n\n","_id":"zenburn@3.0.0","_shasum":"39a3032bace19e2704adc6544e5bc29da51e0119","_resolved":"file:../d-115426-5577-13epd6i/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115426-5577-13epd6i/package.tgz"}
