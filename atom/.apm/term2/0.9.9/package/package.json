You can run **Vim, Emacs, Htop, etc.** in your Atom.\nIt's based on `pty.js` as shell spawner, and `term.js` as xterm, with the power of Atom Package environment.\n\nIt's a fork and rebuilt version of \"[Term][1]\" package.\n\n## What about this fork ?!\nMy fork just adds a 'ShellOverride' configuration option which allows to override the shell Term2 is using (your default shell).\n\nIf, like me, your default shell is zsh you see that it's not yet fully compatible with Term2 (scrolling do not work): setting ShellOverride \nto i.e. 'bash' let you use Term2 with another (working) shell without messing up with your default shell configuration. \nThats all :)\n\n\nTo install **Term2** easily into your Atom;\n\n```bash\napm install term2\n```\n\n![Vim, Emacs and HTop](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20947008/webbox/atom/atom-term3.png)\n\n## Key Bindings and Events\n\n| key binding | event | action |\n| ----------- | ----- | ------ |\n| `ctrl + alt + t` | `term2:open` | Opens new terminal tab pane |\n| `ctrl + alt + up`| `term2:open-split-up` | Opens new terminal tab pane in up split |\n| `ctrl + alt + right`| `term2:open-split-right` | Opens new terminal tab pane in right split |\n| `ctrl + alt + down`| `term2:open-split-down` | Opens new terminal tab pane in down split |\n| `ctrl + alt + left`| `term2:open-split-left` | Opens new terminal tab pane in left split |\n| `ctrl + k, t, t` | `term2:open` | Opens new terminal tab pane |\n| `ctrl + k, t, up`| `term2:open-split-up` | Opens new terminal tab pane in up split |\n| `ctrl + k, t, right`| `term2:open-split-right` | Opens new terminal tab pane in right split |\n| `ctrl + k, t, down`| `term2:open-split-down` | Opens new terminal tab pane in down split |\n| `ctrl + k, t, left`| `term2:open-split-left` | Opens new terminal tab pane in left split |\n| `cmd + k, t, t` | `term2:open` | Opens new terminal tab pane |\n| `cmd + k, t, up`| `term2:open-split-up` | Opens new terminal tab pane in up split |\n| `cmd + k, t, right`| `term2:open-split-right` | Opens new terminal tab pane in right split |\n| `cmd + k, t, down`| `term2:open-split-down` | Opens new terminal tab pane in down split |\n| `cmd + k, t, left`| `term2:open-split-left` | Opens new terminal tab pane in left split |\n| `ctrl + insert | `term2:copy` | Copy text (if `ctrl + c` is not working) |\n| `shift + insert | `term2:paste` | Paste text (if `ctrl + v` is not working) |\n\n## Customize Title\n\nYou can customize Title with using some variables.
