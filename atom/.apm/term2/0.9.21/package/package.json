These are the current variables you can use:\n\n| title variable | value |\n| -------------- | ----- |\n| `bashName` | Current Shell's name, (e.g. bash, zsh) |\n| `hostName` | OS's host name |\n| `platform` | Platform name, (e.g. darwin, linux) |\n| `home` | Home path of current user |\n\nDefault version of **title template** is\n\n```\nTerminal ({{ bashName }})\n```\n\n## Additional Features\n\n  - **Run a defined command automatically** when shell session starts.\n  - You can customize font-family or font-size (default to Atom settings values)\n  - You can define **Terminal Colors** in `config.cson`.\n  - Turn on or off **blinking cursor**\n  - Change **scrollback** limit\n  - Start shell sessions with additional parameters.\n  - You can **pipe the text and paths** to the Terminal sessions.\n  - Paste from clipboard\n\n### Note about colors\n\nCurrently, you will need to adjust the colors in `config.cson`\n(then you should be able to edit them in the package settings view).\n\nYou can add something like (please note the 2 examples of color format):\n\n```cson\nterm2:\n  colors:\n    normalBlack: #000\n    normalRed:\n      red: 255\n      blue: 0\n      green: 0\n      alpha: 1\n    normalGreen: ...\n    normalYellow: ...\n    normalBlue: ...\n    normalPurple: ...\n    normalCyan: ...\n    normalWhite: ...\n    brightBlack: ...\n    brightRed: ...\n    brightGreen: ...\n    brightYellow: ...\n    brightBlue: ...\n    brightPurple: ...\n    brightCyan: ...\n    brightWhite: ...\n    background: ...\n    foreground: ...\n```\n\n- **Colors are not taken from the Atom theme.**\n- alpha channel are not used for now.\n- _The background color is for now the only exception and is not used.\nThe background is transparent so you benefit of Atom app background color._\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why some commands do not work like in my previous terminal ?\n\nIt's [a known `$PATH` issue](https://github.com/webBoxio/atom-term2/issues/50).\nYou are probably an OS X user (if not, let us know).\nGUI app doesn't get `/etc/paths` (and might come from `/usr/local/bin`).\nThere is some workaround for OS X 10.9-, but OS X 10.10+ doesn't execute\n`/etc/launchd.conf` anymore.\nSo, in order to get the right PATH in atom-term2 context, you have this\nsolutions:\n\n- In your `.(bash|zsh|*)rc`, add\n\n  ```bash\n  export PATH=$(cat /etc/paths | xargs | tr \" \" :)\n  # or just hardcode your path like this\n  export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n  ```\n\n- You can automatically call a command when you open a terminal to `login` by\nediting your Atom config:\n\n  ```cson\n  term2:\n    autoRunCommand: 'login -f `whoami`'\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## [Contributors](https://github.com/webBoxio/atom-term2/graphs/contributors)\n\n## [License](LICENSE)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/f/atom-term2/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/f/atom-term2","_id":"term2@0.9.21","_shasum":"8e3543ce3b113106b7e02ad2f19d8b4f99867ae4","_resolved":"file:../d-115119-1181-1wub0l8/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115119-1181-1wub0l8/package.tgz"}
