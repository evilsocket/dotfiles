You can change the default keymap in `Preferences`:\n\n* Keymap For Confirming A Suggestion\n* Keymap For Navigating The Suggestion List\n\nAdditionally, the keymap can be customized in your keymap.cson:\n\n```coffeescript\n'atom-text-editor:not(mini).autocomplete-active':\n  'tab': 'unset!'\n  'enter': 'autocomplete-plus:confirm'\n  'up': 'unset!'\n  'down': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-p': 'autocomplete-plus:select-previous'\n  'ctrl-n': 'autocomplete-plus:select-next'\n```\n\n## Features\n\n* Shows suggestions while typing\n* Includes a default provider (`FuzzyProvider`):\n  * Wordlist generation happens when you open a file, while editing the file, and on save\n  * Suggestions are calculated using `fuzzaldrin`\n* Exposes a provider API which can be used to extend the functionality of the package and provide targeted / contextually correct suggestions\n* Disable autocomplete for file(s) via blacklisting\n* Disable autocomplete for editor scope(s) via blacklisting\n\n## Provider API\n\nGreat autocomplete depends on having great autocomplete providers. If there is not already a great provider for the language / grammar that you are working in, please consider creating a provider.\n\n[Read the `Provider API` documentation](https://github.com/atom-community/autocomplete-plus/wiki/Provider-API) to learn how to create a new autocomplete provider.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom-community/autocomplete-plus/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom-community/autocomplete-plus","_id":"autocomplete-plus@2.2.0","_shasum":"f63cacad0f887dfdeaf66bdb167053d52c05c9f7","_resolved":"file:../d-115124-944-1qlmt1t/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115124-944-1qlmt1t/package.tgz"}
